previous orders page/logic

Make sure: that the arduino works:
-> The admin page should recieve a 'flash' notification which shows
 the requests sent from the arduino when it has a ready order (from the oven)
one of the buttons is used -> start a timer on the arduino(show how much a pizza should be in the oven)
and the second button is used -> the arduino to tell the 'admin' that the pizza is ready 
(in case he didn't hear the buzzer)

stripes' payment page needs to finnished (but first they need to verify me)

pages flow png is dated

known bugs, sometimes logout when pressed from about_us page -> doesn't logout

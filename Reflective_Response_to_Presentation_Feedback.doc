We appreciate the valuable feedback on our recent presentation and are committed to refining our approach based on these insights.

We recognize the importance of clearly naming our project, “Latte's Pizzeria ” rather than just naming it "the project." This clarity will make our presentation more memorable and engaging. We also acknowledge the need to avoid technical jargon, instead we'll try to focus on how features, such as data storage, benefit stakeholders by ensuring accuracy and reliability, rather than explaining the technical details.

For the future, we'll make sure to plan and show the actual application in a more professional action. Instead of broadly stating that "requirements were met," we’ll link each feature to specific client need, making the project’s value more solid.

We’re pleased that our open communication about ongoing client discussions was well received, as this builds trust and shows our commitment to client satisfaction. For the future, we'll work on maintaining a consistent design and fonts throughout the app for a more cohesive UX. Also we'll make sure to aim for more engaging presentations keeping our  which tone will reflect our dedication to the work/project.

Thank you for the feedback, it will greatly enhance our future work.

- Introduction to ''the project'' --> don't say the project, name the actual project.
- Don't give technical details when talking about your solution, having a database won't mean a lot to your stakeholders.
- The showing of th lay-out did not really add anything, just show the actual application.
- The demo was a bit all over a place, a lot of back and forth, make sure to show a logical userflow.
- How is the website a solution to the problem? ''requirements were met'' does not make sense when not made concrete.
- Nice that Ivan mentioned that there are some things ''that still need to be discussed with the client''.
- Make sure you stay consistent in style on your application.
- Nice to have some humour in your presentation but there is a balance and we do want to feel that you take your work seriously.
